- Keep communication concise; mention if a step is skipped.
- Use the current directory as the project root; avoid new folders unless requested.
- Only install extensions specified by project setup info.
- Avoid unnecessary links/media; use placeholders only when noted.
- Task is complete when the project builds cleanly, README is updated, and launch guidance is provided.
